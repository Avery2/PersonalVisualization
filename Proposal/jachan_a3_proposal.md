# Project Proposal

Justin "Avery" Chan

The data that I will collect will focus on the broad topic of "personal productivity." I will use Qbserve (app) to track app usage on my computer, Toggl (app) to self-report when I work, and a collection of task completion through to-do list apps.

For the first two apps, I will be collecting time data that track work. The factors will be the duration and start/end times and the levels will be time units. Additionally, a "category" factor will have levels of the type of application used or type of work done. The completed tasks will have a Factor of date completed and task category. 

The following sketch is a possible visual. Each bubble is a task. The size corresponds to the duration spent according to Toggl and Qbserve data. The color corresponds to the task category.
